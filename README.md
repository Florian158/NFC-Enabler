# NFC-Enabler

This is a simple android app that opens the nfc settings to quickle enable or disbale nfc on a phone.
Previously on my old phone there was a shortcut, but on my new pixel 8 it is not there anymore.

## Future improvements

In Android 16 this method will be added to the sdk:
<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/nfc/NfcAdapter#enable()>
If this available the app will be extented to use this functionality.

## How to run

This app was build in android studio, just enable USB-Debugging in Developer settings on your device and let it build from android studio there.
